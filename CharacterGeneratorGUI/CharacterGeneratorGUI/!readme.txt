Kingdoms Will Burn.wav was replaced with an empty file because the original sound file was too large for GitHub. This might cause an error.

The .exe's were also deleted because they were too big for GitHub. This should be fine, as they will be rebuilt when the code is ran.

Also deleted CharacterGeneratorGUI.Properties.Resources.resources because it was too large for GitHub. Not sure if this will cause an error, but a backup can be found on Google Drive. File existed at obj/Debug/
